    <h2>What is MVC?</h2>

    <p>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is an architectural/design pattern that separates
        an application into three main logical components Model, View, and Controller.
        Each architectural component is built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
        It isolates the business logic and presentation layer from each other. It was traditionally used
        for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Nowadays, MVC is one of the most frequently used
        industry-standard web development frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects.
        It is also used for designing mobile apps.</p>

    <p>MVC was created by Trygve Reenskaug. The main goal of this design pattern was to solve the problem
        of users controlling a large and complex data set by splitting a large application into specific
        sections that all have their own purpose.</p>

    <h3>Features of MVC :</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>It provides a clear separation of business logic, Ul logic, and input logic.</li>
        <li>It offers full control over your HTML and URLs which makes it easy to design web application architecture.</li>
        <li>It is a powerful URL-mapping component using which we can build applications that have comprehensible and searchable URLs.</li>
        <li>It supports Test Driven Development (TDD).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages of MVC:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Codes are easy to maintain and they can be extended easily.</li>
        <li>The MVC model component can be tested separately.</li>
        <li>The components of MVC can be developed simultaneously.</li>
        <li>It supports Test Driven Development (TDD).</li>
        <li>It works well for Web apps that are supported by large teams of web designers and developers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Disadvantages of MVC:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>It is difficult to read, change, test, and reuse this model.</li>
        <li>It is not suitable for building small applications.</li>
        <li>The inefficiency of data access in view.</li>
        <li>The framework navigation can be complex as it introduces new layers of abstraction
            which requires users to adapt to the decomposition criteria of MVC.</li>
    </ol>
